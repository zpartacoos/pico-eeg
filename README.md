Attempting to develop a FLOSS Pico-based EEG interface that allows users to cheaply assemble their own circuit with off-the-shelf components and train an embedded machine learning model to be able to control GPIO pins with their brain waves (i.e ability to turn LEDs or other components on with your thoughts).

### Rough Plan:
- validate Pico's capability for running ML models by using dummy data from EEG data sets
- develop EEG circuit
- integrate the software and hardware

### Tools:
- Software:
  - TensorFlow Lite micro
  - Pico C/C++ SDK
- Hardware:
  - Raspberry Pi Pico
  - EEG components (TBC)

### Status:
- Software:
  - Jupyter notebook with EEG model

A word on the use of **GitHub** as the primary platform for the code hosting of this project:

As many of my social media followers are aware, I have criticized Microsoft a lot in the past. Many people see this at odds with using a platform owned by them. However, I believe that GitHub can change things within MS now that the Steve Ballmer days are over. Perhaps I'm a foolish optimist who will regret his decision in the future, but for now, I am giving them the full benefit of the doubt and hope they raise to the standards of the FLOSS community rather than try to bring us down.
